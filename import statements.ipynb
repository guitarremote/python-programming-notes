    "### What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The import statement\n",
    "You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`import some_file`\n",
    "\n",
    "When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening over and over again if multiple imports occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The from.. import statement\n",
    "Python's from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace.For example, look at the below import statement <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`from fib import fibonacci`\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol table of the importing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The from...import * Statement\n",
    "It is also possible to import all names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "`from modname import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locating modules\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences âˆ’\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current directory.\n",
    "* If the module isn't found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "* If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the sys.path variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default."

    "Consider there are three files named `Bat.py`,`Ball.py`,`Field.py` having functions named `Bat`,`Ball`,`Field` respectively in `Cricket` directory.

    "\n",
    "We see a code block like `if __name_=='__main__'` very often in a lot of python codes. You might be wondering what is this doing and why exactly do people use this. When python runs a file, before it even goes it through the code, it sets up a few special variables. One of them is `__name__`. When python runs a file directly, it sets the `__name__` variable to `__main__`."
