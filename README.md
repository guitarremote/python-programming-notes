# python-programming-notes

This repo consists of a some notes on the basics of programming in python. Some of them are markdown documents and some are jupyter notebooks to help improve the understanding. I have covered the basics of the following topics:

* Container objects and importing data (local and web)
* Classes
* Iterators, Iterables
* Control flows
* `if __name__=='__main__'`

There's still a lot more to cover. Please feel free to contribute. My aim is to make this a one stop place for beginners to brush up their basics.
